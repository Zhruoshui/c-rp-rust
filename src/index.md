# impl Rust for RP2350 - Intro

In this book, we use the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and program it in Rust to explore various exciting projects. You'll work on exercises like dimming an LED, controlling a servo motor, measuring distance with an ultrasonic sensor, displaying the Ferris (🦀) image on an OLED display, using an RFID reader, playing songs on a buzzer, turning on an LED when the room light is off, measuring temperature, and much more.

## Meet the hardware - Pico 2

We will be using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2, which is based on the new RP2350 chip. It offers dual-core flexibility with support for ARM Cortex-M33 cores and optional Hazard3 RISC-V cores. By default, it operates using the standard ARM cores, but developers can choose to experiment with the RISC-V architecture if needed.

You find more details from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/).

> [!NOTE]
> There is an older Raspberry Pi Pico that uses the RP2040 chip. In this book, we will be using the newer **Pico 2** with the **RP2350** chip. When buying hardware, make sure to get the correct one!

There is also a variant called the Pico 2 W, which includes Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth capabilities and is powered by the RP2350 chip. However, it is not fully compatible with the examples we've provided. If you want to follow along without adjustments, we recommend using the standard Pico 2 (non‑wireless) version. If you choose to buy the Pico 2 W or already have one, you still can follow along. Expect small differences, such as the onboard LED being used by Wi-Fi by default, but the core concepts remain the same.

The **H** variants of both include a pinheader, which makes development a bit easier.
